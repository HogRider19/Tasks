The number 81 has a special property, a certain power of the sum of
its digits is equal to 81 (nine squared). Eighty one (81), is the first
number in having this property (not considering numbers of one digit).
The next one, is 512. Let's see both cases with the details
We need to make a function that receives a number as argument
n and returns the n-th term of this sequence of numbers.
