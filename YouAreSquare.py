"""
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead,
you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in
vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number
of building blocks is a perfect square
