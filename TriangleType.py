    In this kata, you should calculate the type of triangle
    with three given sides a, b and c (given in any order).
    If each angle is less than 90째, this triangle
    is acute and the function should return 1.
    If one angle is strictly 90째, this triangle
    is right and the function should return 2.
    If one angle is more than 90째, this triangle
    is obtuse and the function should return 3.
    If three sides cannot form a triangle, or one angle is 180째
    (which turns the triangle into a segment) - the function should return 0.
